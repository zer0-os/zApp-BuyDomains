# Buy Domains dApp

A zApp for purchasing namespace in the Zero ecosystem.

## Running Locally

_This project is in the early stages of development - dx may be lacking._

This package exports a component - in order to work on this zApp you will have to import the component (through `npm link`) to a container app and render it with the required props. It is intended to run in the context of [zNS-dapp](https://github.com/zer0-os/zNS-dapp) and [zOS](https://github.com/zer0-os/zOS), so we recommend using either of these apps as the container for the time being.

Further documentation is on the way.
